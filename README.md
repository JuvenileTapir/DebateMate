This program is intended to enable debaters to calculate the number of points they need to break to the final at a competition. It takes four parameters: first, the number of rooms, second, the number of rounds, third, the number of teams, and fourth, the number of desired samples, to output the likelihood of various scenarios; these scenarios include the number of points required and the number of teams with that number of points who will break; the program uses the Monte Carlo method.
It is advised to run between 1000 and 50000 iterations, because below this, some possibilities may be omitted, and the probabilities may be extremely skewed, and running the program more than 50000 times yields few benefits but takes a rather long time.
